(108 when not counting English and North Korean, as North Korean has not been translated yet [Read about it here](/OldVersions/Korean(North)/README.md))

Translations in languages other than English are machine translated and are not yet accurate. No errors have been fixed yet as of March 21st 2021. Please report translation errors [here](https://github.com/seanpm2001/SeansLifeArchive_Extras_Wikipedia/issues/). Make sure to backup your correction with sources and guide me, as I don't know languages other than English well (I plan on getting a translator eventually) please cite [wiktionary](https://en.wiktionary.org) and other sources in your report. Failing to do so will result in a rejection of the correction being published.

Note: due to limitations with GitHub's interpretation of markdown (and pretty much every other web-based interpretation of markdown) clicking these links will redirect you to a separate file on a separate page that isn't the intended page. You will be redirected to the [.github folder](/.github/) of this project, where the README translations are hosted.

Note: currently, translations in languages other than English only apply to version 2. You must speak English to use this specification until a verified translation for the latest version is available.

---

Applies to: every digital device that uses a camera of any image/video/audio quality. The main focus goes to a lid that covers the camera entirely.

## Lid

### Definition

![Graphics/Lid/GIF/LID.gif](/Graphics/Lid/GIF/LID.gif)

A lid is a cover that slides over the camera, preventing it from recording anything but the lid.

A rollover lid must be applicable to every camera. The lid must be 100% opaque, with absolutely no transparency/translucency, and it must be durable enough to last 50 or more years. The lid cannot be connected to any wireless connection, including but not limited to:

- Wi-Fi

- BlueTooth

- LAN

- WLAN

- 1x data

- 2G data

- 3G data

- 4G data

- 5G data

- 6G data

- Cloud

### Detachability and software support

The lid must be detachable with open source software, and there has to be a choice for the user to choose a different lid opening software/application if needed. Creators of lid opening software must follow this specification as well. The software for the lid cannot rely on system time or UNIX time, and must be 64 bit. The lid cannot be locked to expire at a certain date.

### Opening and closing

The lid must take no more than 10 seconds to open and close electronically or manually (For manual opening, the user can take however long they want, but it must be doable within 10 seconds, even by an infant). The lid must be able to be closed or opened both with software, and with manual force (even with the hand of a weak infant) the lid must be secure.

### Additional cameras, Internet connnections, and virtual assistants

The lid cannot contain additional cameras or other tracking devices. The lid cannot integrate with "smart" software assistants/virtual assistants, including but not limited to:

* Google Assistant

* Samsung Bixby

* Amazon Alexa

* Apple Siri

### Inclusion with the device

The lid must be included with the device, it cannot be a separate component. The lid must be repairable and replaceable at any time, with or without a device warranty.

### Following the specification

The lid specification must be followed in its entirety, without cherrypicking. You must always follow the latest version of the lid specification from the original author, even if it is not available in your native language.

Note: currently, translations in languages other than English only apply to version 2. You must speak English to use this specification until a verified translation for the latest version is available.

### Additional cameras

The lid itself cannot contain cameras on it or around it. Any other cameras must also come with a lid with all the same rules listed in this specification.

### Specification application

The specification applies to all users, including but not limited to the user, the government, corporations, foundations, organizations, communities, etc.

### Lid labels

The lid cannot contain any labels that persuade the user not to use the lid. You are allowed to put your company logo on the lid, but it can't damage its lifespan or suggest that the lid is faulty.

### License

The software for the lid can only be applied under the following licenses:

- GNU General Public License [V2 or later]

- MIT No Attribution License

- BSD Zero Clause License

The lid specification is covered by the GNU General Public License version 3.

### Pending approval

The specification is pending approval from the following computer manufacturing companies and brands:

- [ ] Dell

- [ ] Asus

- [ ] Acer

- [ ] Alienware

- [ ] Microsoft Corp

- [ ] Google LLC/Alphabet Inc
